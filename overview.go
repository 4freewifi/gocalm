/*

Yet Another REST Framework in Go

1. `net/http` + `gorilla/mux` are enough to create a RESTful service,
so this is just a light weight framework built on top of them to make
life a little easier.

2. It tries to follow best practices of RESTful API, and hide these
practices into the framework.

3. Simple and clear syntax to make your code self-doucumented.

4. Built-in OPTIONS method.

Check `example_test.go` for an working example.
